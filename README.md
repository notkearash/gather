# Gather
A Python script to gather my bash script (commands) around (ironic)

## Setup
First make sure you have the python installed on your system.
```bash
$ python3 --version

```
Then set execution premission to the script
```bash

As you might noticed there is a `example.yaml` file in the repo.

This is the example configuration to demo how to save your shell commands

```yaml

    - 'echo hello'
2:
    - 'ls'
    - 'neofetch'
```
**Note:** Only accepting `int` as inputs at the moment.
